-   I completed my B.Sc. in Forensic Science at the University of Glamorgan
(2008). My undergraduate degree gave a broad overview of methods within the
field, from blood splatter analysis to recovering deleted files on hard drives.

-   Following my undergraduate degree, I completed an M.Sc. in Molecular
Modeling at Cardiff University (2009). Once again, this gave a relatively broad
introduction to concepts within the field. This ranged from using cheap
empirical potentials for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to modeling
protein folding to high-level coupled-cluster calculations on small molecules.

-   I then progressed to study a Ph.D. as part of the Doctoral Training Centre
for hydrogen fuel Cells and their application at the University of Birmingham
(2014). This involved more in-depth studies of catalysts for application in the
oxygen reduction reaction. This included a number of main studies, with a focus
on the investigation of alloying effects. Utilizing search methods coupled with
density functional theory to investigate the structural characteristics of
sub-nano scale clusters. Comparing models of discrete systems such as
nanoparticles to commonly used extended surfaces.

-   After completing my doctoral studies I undertook a two-year postdoctoral
position at the Technical University of Denmark. Here I focused more on the
development of search methods. I ultimately developing a genetic algorithm
coupled with machine learning giving a significant reduction in the
computational cost for the studies typically undertaken for high-throughput
computation screening of materials.

-   Since 2016 I have undertaken a second postdoctoral appointment at Stanford
University. This has given me chance to focus on improving the machine learning
method employed in building models to address the challenges in materials
chemistry and catalysis.
