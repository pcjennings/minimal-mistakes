## General
I am a computational chemist focusing on the application of machine learning to
high-throughput materials screening problems. I focus on researching and
applying Gaussian processes machine learning methodologies, implementing
techniques described in research papers and designing experiments. I am
currently working in the field of materials discovery for Hydrogen Fuel Cell
(HFC) technologies, researching nanoparticle systems of potential interest that
address shortcomings in stability and activity at the cathode for catalyzing
the oxygen reduction reaction. I am particularly interested in global
optimization of nanoparticles using search techniques such as genetic
algorithms. This allows for the investigation of realistic structures before
assessing catalytic activity.

I focus on applications in the limit of small data. Typically the problems we
wish to address don't have large datasets and we can greatly improve the
efficiency of studies through an iterative selection of the best calculations
to perform next. I apply Gaussian processes regression to determine which
calculations to perform that are likely to either be optimal solutions to the
problem or develop the underlying model. This is achieved through the employ of
different acquisition functions coupled with uncertainty estimates on all
predictions.
