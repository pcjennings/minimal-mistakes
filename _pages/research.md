## General
I am a computational chemist focusing on the application of machine learning to
high-throughput materials screening problems. I focus on researching and
applying Gaussian processes machine learning methodologies, implementing
techniques described in research papers and designing experiments. I am
currently working in the field of materials discovery for Hydrogen Fuel Cell
(HFC) technologies, researching nanoparticle systems of potential interest that
address shortcomings in stability and activity at the cathode for catalyzing
the oxygen reduction reaction. I am particularly interested in global
optimization of nanoparticles using search techniques such as genetic
algorithms. This allows for the investigation of realistic structures before
assessing catalytic activity.
